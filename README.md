# Odin TicTacToe

This is the **Tic-Tac-Toe** project of the The Odin Project. (See: [Project Tic Tac Toe](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe)) 
In this project the aim is to build an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game to play in your browser.

Focus of the project is to use the concepts learned in the previous chapter of scope (refresher), closures and module patterns.
**It is supposed to use as little as global code as possible**
